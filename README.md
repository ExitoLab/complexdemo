A more complex demo for the Vancouver Test Automation Group

This is meant to be reviewed in tandem with https://github.com/julienescueta/simpledemo.

In this repo, we take simpledemo and improve upon its maintainability and readability by using some features in CasperJS:

1. Custom command-line arguments
 * http://casperjs.org/cli.html
2. Modules + domain specific language
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language
3. Pre-test CLI argument
